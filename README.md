# NewsUpdate- A React App



- The main objective of the app is to provide users with a convenient and free way to access their daily news.
- Users can click on individual news articles to read the full article on the source website, as the app provides a direct link to the 
   original source.
- The app utilizes the NewsAPI, a popular news aggregator API, to fetch the latest news articles from various sources.
- The app employs the concept of infinite scroll, allowing users to continuously scroll through news articles without having to click on 
  pagination links or load more buttons.
